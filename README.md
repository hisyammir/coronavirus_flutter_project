# Coronavirus Flutter Project

I learned how to make a covid19 case tracking application and learned how to use REST APIs in flutter. Just 4 fun :).
I learned from the udemy course.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
